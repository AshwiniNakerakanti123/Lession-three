    <h2>Human Condition</h2>
    <p>Human Condition
        Human Condition videos are primarily about people. 
        Within the Human Condition category, the subcategories 
        are "More than a Day Job", "Defiant", "No Way!?", and 
        "Music to my <span id="dots">....</span><span id="more"> Ears".[12] More than a Day Job covers crafters, 
        artist, innovators and regular people doing their job. 
        These videos include a story about the man that runs
         the last manual scoreboard or the first autistic actor 
         to be cast as the lead in a play. Defiant videos are about
          people who break expectations and societal norms that are 
          put in for them. These videos include stories about a
           bodybuilder with 1 arm and no legs or a Division
            1 college football player that is completely blind. 
            No Way videos are stories about people that many people donâ€™t know.
             One of these videos is about how a high school project inspired 
             the 50-star American flag. The last section in Human Condition 
             is Music to our Ears. Music to our Ears covers stories about 
             songs and musicians that may be surprising. One of these stories 
             includes one about the missing people choir. This choir is full of 
             families and individuals of missing children who come together as a 
             choir, turning their grief into hope.</span></p>
